========

Design Highlights:
* Game is a singleton class, accessible through Game.instance().  This way
  everything that needs access to the currently running game can get it,
  without needing to store references to the Game all over the place.
* Two threads: one updates, the other one draws.
  For potential race conditions (e.g. one thread accesses the list of entities
  while the other changes it), we use Java's synchronized{}.
* Project management: Doxygen for docs, Google Code SVN for code.
* Types of sprites:
  - Tiles (non-moving things that make up the grid of the level.
  - Entities (moving things, like the player and lemmings).
* Collision detection:
  - For tiles: bounding-box method.
  - For entities: straightforward intersection checking.
* Levels:
  - The tile configuration is read from a text file.
  - The entities are created and configured in the corresponding Level
    subclass (see LevelZero.java for a level with highly customized Entities.)
* Most customizable features of the game (FPS, keys, physics constants, etc.)
  are conveniently aggregated in Config.java.

Ideas for the Future (also see game design doc):
* Extend Config.java to handle config files.
* Extend ImageManager.java to handle themes / skins.
* Add more unit tests to the flocktest/ dir.
* Also see TODOs in the code.
