Known Bugs:
* Collision detection is imperfect -- lemmings get stuck sometimes (very
  rarely, probably a timing glitch where an update takes longer than it was
  supposed to).
* Performance can go down a bit when there are very many entities on screen.
* The "debug mode" (enabled in config) was useful when debugging collisions --
  but hasn't been changed / fixed after all the changes that followed it.
* Clicks cause the game to freeze.  I have no idea why.
