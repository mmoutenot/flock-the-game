Design Highlights:
* Game is a singleton class, accessible through Game.instance().  This way
  everything that needs access to the currently running game can get it,
  without needing to store references to the Game all over the place.
* Two threads: one updates, the other one draws.
  For potential race conditions (e.g. one thread accesses the list of entities
  while the other changes it), we use Java's synchronized{}.
